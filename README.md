To use the app:
1. Click on main.exe
2. Then click on view raw
3. It will download it
4. Click on it
5. If it has 1 option (Don't run) due to security, click on 'more info'
6. Then there will be a button that says 'run anyway'. Click on it.
7. I'd recommend to create a folder to store the app inside as all the files wouldn't be scattered all over the place.
